# 🧩 Sum of Numbers With Exactly Four Divisors

## Intuition  
We need to find numbers that have **exactly four divisors**.  
If a number qualifies, we add the **sum of those four divisors** to the total.

A number has exactly four divisors only when:

- it is of the form **p × q** (p and q are distinct primes), or  
- it is of the form **p³** (p is prime)

So instead of checking all numbers up to `n`, we iterate only to `√n`, track divisors, and stop once we know there are more than four.

---

## Approach  

1. Loop through each number.
2. Start with divisors **1** and **n** → `count = 2`, `sum = 1 + n`.
3. Try all divisors from `2` to `√n`.
4. Each valid divisor contributes a pair (`d`, `n/d`) unless it's a perfect square.
5. If divisor count exceeds **4**, stop early.
6. Add the divisor sum only when the count equals **4**.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(\sum \sqrt{n_i}) \)

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(1) \)

## Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumFourDivisors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int total = 0;

        for (int n : nums) {
            int sum = 1 + n;
            int count = 2;

            for (int d = 2; d * d <= n; d++) {
                if (n % d == 0) {
                    int other = n / d;

                    if (d == other) {
                        count++;
                        sum += d;
                    } else {
                        count += 2;
                        sum += d + other;
                    }

                    if (count > 4) break;
                }
            }

            if (count == 4) total += sum;
        }

        return total;
    }
};
