# Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

## Intuition
When we look at the problem, we notice that each *level* of the binary tree has its own sum of node values.  
The task is to find **which level has the highest total sum**.

A natural way to process a tree **level by level** is a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** using a queue.  
So the idea is simple:

- Traverse the tree level by level  
- Compute the sum for each level  
- Track the level that gives the maximum sum

---

## Approach
1. Use a queue and push the root node.
2. Maintain:
   - `level` → current level number (starting from 1)
   - `maxSum` → highest sum seen so far
   - `maxLevel` → level index with the highest sum
3. For each iteration of BFS:
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level.
   - Pop exactly that many nodes from the queue, summing their values.
   - Push their children (if any) back into the queue.
   - Compare the level sum with `maxSum`.  
     If it's larger, update `maxSum` and `maxLevel`.
4. Continue until the queue becomes empty.
5. Return `maxLevel`.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  
  Each node is processed exactly once → **O(n)**

- **Space complexity:**  
  At most, the queue stores one full level of nodes → **O(n)** in the worst case

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLevelSum(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        int level = 1;
        int maxLevel = 1;
        long long maxSum = LONG_LONG_MIN;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            long long levelSum = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();

                levelSum += node->val;

                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }

            if (levelSum > maxSum) {
                maxSum = levelSum;
                maxLevel = level;
            }

            level++;
        }

        return maxLevel;
    }
};
